# Privacy Policy for Airfoil Fitter Fusion

**Last Updated:** January 13, 2026

## Overview
Airfoil Fitter Fusion ("the Add-in") is a tool for Autodesk Fusion that helps users fit B-spline curves to airfoil coordinate data. This privacy policy explains how the Add-in handles user data.

## Data Collection
The Add-in does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data to external servers or third parties.

## Local Data Processing
The Add-in processes data entirely on your local machine:
- Airfoil coordinate data you provide is processed locally within Fusion 360
- Temporary files (such as DXF files) are created in your system's temporary directory during operation
- These temporary files are automatically deleted after use
- No data leaves your computer

## Data Storage
The Add-in does not store any user data, settings, or preferences. All processing occurs in memory or in temporary files that are cleaned up automatically.

## Third-Party Services
The Add-in does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## User Rights
Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is no data to access, modify, or delete.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
